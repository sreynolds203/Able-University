# Able-University

Able University was a project for a mobile application course.
We were to choose a section of an overall project and build an Android app that fit the needs
of the specified section. The section that I chose was to build an online directory for a University
as well as a parking permit service. The users could fill out information and receive an email with 
the verification of the permit.

Android Studio was used to create this project
